create react app

Medium does have an api, but they do not allow for get requests. I could post a new story to medium using thier api.

Is there any way to get my post information from the api. Luckily Medium exposes an rss feed of a user's activity.

According to post, rss is Limited to the last 10 posts, which is ok with me.
